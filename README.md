## Machine_Learning Portfolio Projects
Welcome to my Machine_Learning repository. Here you can find my projects with different machine learning algorithm. In every project I try to enhance my ability in using different algorithm.

## About Me
A passionate data science learner with a keen interest in business analysis through data-driven strategies. I thrive on combining technical expertise with analytical skills to craft intelligent solutions for complex challenges. I strongly believe in optimizing business processes and creating positive impacts by leveraging the power of data. Currently, I am dedicated to expanding my knowledge and skills in data analysis and information-based decision-making.

## Project 1: Iraninan Car Market (Selenium-Random Forest)

This project focuses on predicting the price of used cars in the Iranian market using machine learning. The data was scraped from the BamA website using Selenium, resulting in a dataset of
nearly 8,500 car listings. The goal is to analyze key price-driving factors and build a predictive model using Random Forest Regression.

1) Data Cleaning
   
   âœ…Removed non-numeric values and outliers.

   âœ…Converted mixed calendar years to the Persian calendar.

   âœ…Filtered out pre-sale and non-standard listings.

   âœ…Encoded categorical features (Brand, Model) using LabelEncoder.

   âœ…Calculated CarAge as a key feature.
3) Modeling
   Used Random Forest Regressor to predict car prices.

   âœ…Train-test split: 80/20

   **Evaluation Metrics:**

   ðŸš¨Mean Absolute Error (MAE): ~339007938 IRR

   ðŸš¨RÂ² Score: ~0.82
